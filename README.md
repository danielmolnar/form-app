# PC Shop Form App

The main feature of this [app](https://form-app-silk.vercel.app/) is to validate the data that is populated in the form (e.g. valid email address), before it gets submitted. For this, validator functions were coded, implemented and tested with JEST Testing. Submitting a faulty form results in an error prompt.
